The individual bars on the chart represent matches, and the length of each bar represents the length of time from when the fight started until the time of the fight stoppage. \r\n\r\n## Features\r\nTooltips show additional details of the match (type of knockout,opponent’s name, date of match, round and round time of stoppage).\r\n\r\n## Why did I make this? \r\nI wanted to learn D3 js, and wanted a subject that would keep me interested while learning it. I have enjoyed Mike Tyson’s presence in the media and was a fan of the Nintendo Entertainment System video game that he appeared in back in the 80s ([Mike Tyson’s Punch-Out!!](http://www.ign.com/games/mike-tysons-punch-out/nes-5654)).\r\n\r\n## What tech things were needed?\r\n[D3 js library](http://d3js.org/)\r\n\r\n## Skills learned/retreived:\r\nd3.js","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
